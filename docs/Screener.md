# Screener

The **Screener** in **TradeVed** is built to help traders identify and filter market opportunities using real-time metrics and custom logic. It enables smarter portfolio construction by allowing users to sift through thousands of listed instruments based on financial performance.

## What You Can Screen

The Screener supports a wide range of asset classes:

- **Equities**
- **Futures & Options (F&O)**
- **ETFs**  
If it's live on the market — it can be screened.

## How It Works

On the left panel, you’ll find a **filter control area**:

- Select a **parameter** (e.g., Profit, Loss, PE ratio)
- Choose a **comparison type** (greater than, less than, equal to)
- Enter the **value or percentage**  
  → Example: Show stocks where **Loss > 50%**

You can add multiple conditions to refine results further.

## Results View

The filtered output appears as a **structured list**, showing:

- Symbol and name
- Matched condition(s)

Even if you're filtering by one metric (e.g., Profit), the screener provides a full snapshot of each matching stock.
