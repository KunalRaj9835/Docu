# Strategy Visualizer

The **Strategy Visualizer** in **TradeVed** helps you plan and understand trades before executing them. Whether you're designing complex options strategies or testing a custom equity idea, this tool gives you a detailed view of how your setup behaves under different market conditions.

## Strategy Creation

You can start in two ways:

- **Preloaded templates**: Choose from popular strategies like Bull Call Spread, Iron Condor, Straddle, etc.
- **Custom setup**: Manually configure the legs, expiries, and instruments to build your own strategy

Both types can be adjusted — allowing you to fine-tune entries and assumptions.

## What You Can Visualize

Once your strategy is set up, the tool provides:

- **Payoff graphs**: Visualize profit/loss at expiry
- **Breakeven points**: Clearly marked for risk evaluation
- **Greek calculations**: Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega — updated live
- **Max Profit / Loss zones**: Instant risk-reward feedback

This gives a holistic understanding before any capital is deployed.

---

## Scenario Testing

Use the visualizer to simulate:

- **Market movement**: Adjust underlying price to see live impact
- **Time decay**: Observe strategy behavior over days
- **Volatility shifts**: Analyze how implied volatility affects your position

These variables help you prepare for multiple outcomes.

## Market Data

- By default, the visualizer uses **live market data**
- You can also switch to **delayed or static data** for focused experimentation

This flexibility helps both paper traders and real-time strategists.

## Why It Matters

The Strategy Visualizer is not just a charting tool — it's a **decision support engine**.

Use it to:

- Validate risk-reward setups
- Understand strategy structure in depth
- Practice advanced trading without real exposure
- Avoid avoidable mistakes in high-risk strategies

It's where planning meets precision.
