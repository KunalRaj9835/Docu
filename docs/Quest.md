# Quest

**Quest** is the guided learning engine within **TradeVed**, designed to help users develop strong trading fundamentals through interactive modules. Each quest teaches market concepts, simulates decision-making under varying conditions, and helps traders prepare for real-world execution.

---

## Structure

Quests are organized into **modular checkpoints**. Each module covers a focused topic — such as technical analysis, risk management, or order types — and may include text, visuals, interactive decisions, and challenges.

Features include:

- Visual progress tracking (% completed)
- Unlockable modules as you progress
- Experience points (XP) awarded on completion
- Badge and level system for achievements

Modules are designed to be completed at your pace. Completion unlocks new quests and tool access in later sections.

## Learning Through Simulation

Unlike traditional tutorials, Quests don’t just explain trading — they **simulate market decisions**.

You’ll be asked to:

- Make trade choices based on real-world scenarios
- Handle news events and volatility spikes
- Manage risk under time pressure
- Reflect on outcomes before continuing

This prepares users not only to learn trading but to **react like a trader**.

---

## Progression

Quests are divided across the core trader profiles:

- **Beginner Quests** focus on fundamentals — e.g., understanding stocks, risk basics, technical charts
- **Intermediate Quests** introduce broader exposure — e.g., combining indicators, journaling trades, dealing with losses
- **Advanced Quests** unlock after significant XP — focusing on automation, strategy design, and advanced risk models

Some quests are **unlocked only after completing earlier modules** — ensuring proper conceptual buildup.

---

## Bonus: Quiz Duel

Every module contains **bonus quizzes** — short, high-focus challenges designed to reinforce what you've learned.

- Timed: You have 60 seconds to answer each set
- Optional: Can be skipped and revisited anytime
- Rewarded: Earn extra XP for correct and quick responses

These are not exams — they’re **reinforcement exercises** that keep concepts fresh and reflexes sharp.

## What You Gain

As you complete quests:

- Your **level** increases, unlocking additional features across TradeVed
- You earn **XP and badges** to track your learning journey
- You gain the confidence to take live decisions — in paper mode or live mode

The Quest system ensures that your growth is not only measured — it’s visible.
