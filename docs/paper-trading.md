# Paper Trading

**Paper Trading** in **TradeVed** lets you practise in real-world conditions — without risking real capital. It simulates the full experience of placing, managing, and exiting trades using market-like behavior and dynamic performance tracking.

This feature is ideal after completing Quests, helping you apply what you've learned before entering live markets.

## Real Market Environment — Simulated Risk

While the trades are virtual, the data isn't.

- Trades are placed using a mix of **live** and **historical** data
- Users are **not told** which mode is active — keeping it close to real-life unpredictability
- Performance, price movement, and outcomes respond as they would on actual exchanges

You don’t just practise trading — you practise **decision-making under uncertainty**.

---

## What Can You Trade?

The paper trading system supports a curated list of high-volume, high-relevance instruments, including:

- **NIFTY50**
- **BANKNIFTY**
- Other select equity derivatives and spot instruments

All order types are available:

- Market
- Limit
- Stop-loss
- Trailing stop

---

## Getting Started

When you begin paper trading:

- You are allocated a **default virtual capital** (non-customizable)
- This amount mirrors realistic account funding, as seen with live brokers
- You choose the instrument, define the trade parameters, and execute the order

The simulator handles trade lifecycle — from order to exit — and updates your virtual portfolio accordingly.

You can **start, pause, or stop** trading at any time.

---

## Performance Tracking

You can view:

- Open and closed positions
- Profit/Loss in virtual currency
- Order status and trade history
- Execution timeline

Your trading record builds in the background, helping you reflect and improve without any financial exposure.

---

## Linked to Your Journal

Every paper trade is automatically saved to your **Journal**, where you can:

- Tag trades by strategy, emotion, or outcome
- Annotate entries for later review
- Access them while reviewing intermediate-level material

This creates a seamless loop between learning, practising, and reflecting.

---

## Why It Matters

Theory builds knowledge. **Paper trading builds experience.**

It’s a safe space for:

- Testing strategies
- Building emotional discipline
- Understanding execution flow
- Experiencing real risk scenarios — without real risk

Paper Trading prepares you for the market, not just in knowledge — but in reflexes.
