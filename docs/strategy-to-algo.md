# Strategy to Algo

**Strategy to Algo** in **TradeVed** bridges the gap between strategy building and real-world execution. Once you’ve developed and tested a trading strategy, this feature helps you convert it into an automated trading logic — without having to write code.

---

## How It Works

This feature allows you to **input your strategy conditions** in a structured and intuitive way — similar to writing code, but through an interface designed for traders. It abstracts the complexity of syntax and focuses on logic.

You define:

- Entry and exit rules
- Risk parameters (e.g., stop-loss, max loss)
- Instruments (Stocks, Options, Futures, etc.)

---

## Code Optional

While the entire flow is **no-code by default**, experienced users can optionally dive into low-level code customization if needed.

---

## Execution Settings

You can configure various aspects of execution:

- Order type (market, limit)
- Lot size
- Capital allocation
- Stop trading conditions (e.g., loss threshold hit)

Once your logic is defined, it’s ready to move into automation.

---

## Broker Integration

Live deployment is supported with the following brokers:

- **Zerodha**
- **Dhan**  
Broker connection is **mandatory** for live execution.

---

## Test Before You Run

While there’s no step-by-step debugger, users can preview how the strategy behaves via **mock test mode**. This simulates execution without risking real capital and helps you observe how conditions are triggered in a controlled environment.

---

## Smart Automation, Real Decisions

The goal of Strategy to Algo is not full blind automation — but **decision-enhanced automation**. Certain tasks like entries, exits, and adjustments are automated, but the final decision-making remains in the hands of the trader, especially in unpredictable market scenarios.

---

## Why Strategy to Algo?

- Eliminate manual execution delays
- Ensure consistent behavior in your strategy
- Free up time for higher-level decisions
- Make your trading system scalable

Whether you’re refining a concept or scaling to live trades, this feature helps you **convert insight into action** — efficiently and intelligently.
