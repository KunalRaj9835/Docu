# Journal

The **Journal** in **TradeVed** is your personal trading notebook — designed to help you reflect, record, and revisit your trading journey. Whether you're making entries about executed trades, insights from Quests, or mistakes to avoid, the Journal provides a private, structured space to document your process.

## How It Works

You can maintain your Journal in multiple ways:

- **Type manually**: Write daily reflections, mistakes, or ideas in plain text
- **Upload trade data**: Import a `.csv` file to log what you traded, when, and how
- **Scan handwritten notes**: Upload scanned pages or snapshots of offline notes

Entries are private and only visible to you.

## Entry Features

Each Journal entry can include:

- **Notes**: Freeform typing, reflections, or trade commentary
- **Tags**: Label entries by strategy, instrument, emotion, or lesson
- **CSV imports**: Attach trade logs for reference
- **Scans**: Upload visual notes or whiteboard snapshots

There's no fixed format — the goal is flexibility, so every trader can use it their way.

## Organization & Filtering

As your journal grows, you can:

- Filter by **tags** to locate specific types of entries
- Sort by **date** or category
- Maintain daily, weekly, or event-based entries

This makes it easier to build patterns, track your mindset, and recall important insights over time.

## Why It Matters

Trading isn’t just about execution — it’s about **consistency, clarity, and continuous learning**.

The Journal helps you:

- Track what worked — and what didn’t
- Catch repeating mistakes
- Clarify your thoughts before or after the market session
- Build personal accountability

It’s not about statistics or visuals — it’s about building a **habit of reflection**.
