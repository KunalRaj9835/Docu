# Backtest

The **Backtest** feature in **TradeVed** allows traders to evaluate the performance of their strategies using historical data. Whether you're refining an options play, a futures breakout model, or testing a custom equity setup — this tool helps validate your logic before execution.

---

## What You Can Backtest

TradeVed supports backtesting across multiple asset classes:

- Stocks
- Options
- Futures
- Any instrument available in the live market

If it can be traded, it can be tested.

---

## Strategy Setup

Users can choose how to define their strategy:

- **Visual Builder**: Use a user-friendly UI to choose from preset strategies and customize inputs (e.g., Buy when RSI < 30)
- **Custom Logic Input**: Input your own conditions to simulate a personalized strategy

Both options are flexible and designed to give you maximum control over your setup.

---

## Data & Timeframe

TradeVed supports:

- **Real Historical Market Data** (not synthetic)
- Full control over **custom date ranges**
  → Example: Jan 2020 to Dec 2022 for a two-year test

This gives you the ability to test performance in specific market conditions — bullish, bearish, or sideways.

---

## Output Metrics

Once the test is run, the system displays:

- **Profit / Loss over time**
- **Greek analysis** (for options strategies)
- **Payoff structure**
- Key statistics such as:
  - Win ratio
  - Risk-reward ratio
  - Max drawdown
  - Capital utilization

All visualized clearly to inform your next steps.

## From Test to Execution

If your strategy performs well:

- You can **push it live** using our **Strategy to Algo** feature
- Requires an active **broker connection**
- TradeVed will handle conversion and execution routing

---

## Why Backtest Matters

Backtesting helps you:

- Validate assumptions and logic using real data
- Avoid untested strategies in live environments
- Prepare for automated deployment confidently

In short, it turns your trading idea into a **data-backed decision**.
