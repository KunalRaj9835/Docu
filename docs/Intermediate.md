# Intermediate

The Intermediate section in **TradeVed** is designed for traders with working knowledge of markets — typically with 1 to 3 years of experience. These users have executed trades, understand market cycles, and are ready to operate with more structure in live conditions. The focus is no longer just on learning — it’s about refining and applying.

This stage introduces three key tools: **Journal**, **Screener**, and **Copy Trading**. All features in this section are integrated with live markets and broker connectivity.

## Journal

The **Journal** functions as a personal trading notebook. It helps you record, reflect, and revisit your decisions over time.

Key features:

- Manual trade entries with optional broker-linked tagging
- Add context, screenshots, or notes to each entry
- Tag-based filtering (e.g., setup type, mistake, strategy, sector)
- Designed to build decision-making awareness, not visual stats

This tool supports thoughtful execution. Over time, it becomes your personal reference — showing what worked and what didn’t.

## Screener

The **Screener** is designed to narrow down the universe of stocks or instruments using both technical and fundamental filters.

Key features:

- Remove companies based on loss thresholds (e.g., exclude stocks down 50% YTD)
- Apply technical rules (e.g., RSI < 30, Moving Average crossovers)
- Add financial metrics (e.g., PE Ratio, Market Cap, Earnings Growth)
- Save and re-use custom filter sets


The screener helps you stay focused, cut out noise, and build your own list of actionable opportunities.

## Copy Trading *(Broker Connection Required)*

**Copy Trading** lets you allocate capital to mirror strategies of other verified traders. This is fully user-controlled and designed for flexibility.

Key features:

- Browse and review trader performance profiles
- Set limits before copying (capital cap, number of trades per day, etc.)
- View open and closed positions in real-time
- Stop copying anytime without losing visibility

This tool is especially useful for observing experienced traders, gaining real-market exposure, and learning from strategy flows.

## How to Use These Tools Together

You’re encouraged to:

- Use the **Journal** to log trades and notes — especially where decisions felt uncertain
- Run your **Screener** daily or weekly to maintain a clean, opportunity-rich watchlist
- Explore **Copy Trading** for comparative learning and passive diversification

Together, these tools shift your approach from trial-based to process-based trading.

## What to Expect

Using these tools, you will begin operating under real market conditions. Unlike simulated trading, decisions now carry weight — emotionally and strategically.

This experience builds:

- Market timing awareness
- Pattern recognition through repetition
- Risk understanding through exposure
- Trade documentation habits

You’re no longer testing ideas in a sandbox — you’re executing in a real environment. These tools help ensure it’s structured, repeatable, and adaptive.
