# Copy Trading

**Copy Trading** in **TradeVed** allows you to automatically mirror the trades of experienced traders — helping you gain exposure to real strategies while maintaining control over risk.

It’s designed for users who want to learn through observation, participate in the market, or take a semi-passive approach while building confidence.

## How It Works

When Copy Trading is enabled:

- You choose an expert trader based on their performance, strategy type, or risk level
- As the expert places trades, the same trades are **automatically executed** in your connected account
- Profits and losses reflect proportionally, based on your capital settings

This process is seamless and happens in real-time — no manual confirmation required.

## Choosing Traders

You can discover traders through:

- **Manual browsing**: View profiles, past performance, and preferred segments
- **Filters**: Narrow down by risk level, return consistency, or segment (e.g., Index, Options)
- **Recommendations**: TradeVed highlights traders based on your own trading behavior and risk profile

Transparency is core — you can review detailed stats before connecting to any trader.

## Risk Management

Before copying a trader, you can configure:

- **Capital limits**: Set how much of your capital will be used
- **Stop thresholds**: Automatically pause copying after a predefined loss
- **Trade volume filters**: Control maximum trades per day or per segment

These safeguards ensure that **you remain in control**, even while trades are automated.

---

## Requirements

- Copy Trading **requires a connected broker account**
- TradeVed will execute trades through this account on your behalf
- All execution is subject to real-time conditions and brokerage infrastructure

Users must grant permission and acknowledge risk before activating Copy Trading.

## What’s Being Traded?

Copied trades can span any asset class supported by the lead trader — including:

- **NIFTY50**, **BANKNIFTY**, other equity/index instruments
- Intraday or positional strategies
- Segment-based exclusions (if configured by you)

You copy only what the trader trades — and only within your defined rules.

---

## Incentives

Copied traders (the experts) receive a **small share of your net profit** when their strategies generate gains. This aligns incentives:

- You benefit from professional trade ideas
- They benefit by performing well for their followers

TradeVed ensures all reward mechanics are transparent and fair.

## Why It Matters

Copy Trading helps you:

- Learn how seasoned traders operate under live conditions
- Participate in the market without making every decision manually
- Build trust in process, risk control, and discipline

It’s not just automation — it’s **a bridge between theory and independent execution**.
